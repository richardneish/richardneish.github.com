<h2>Stark</h2>
<p>
The English landscape today has a harsh starkness to it.  Not for here the organic, fuzzy fusion of colours and textures melding into one another.  No, here elements stand aloof, alone and wholly distinct.  Where textures and colours change they change abruptly as if a razor chops them off.  The light blue of the clear sky, unfussed by clouds or haze.  Bang! shapes of trees intrude into the blankness with a burst of solid dark green, or more recently the yellow and brown of autumn.  Lower down a recently planted field spreads an undisturbed, even carpet of vivid green, combed through with fastidiously neat furrows and bordered tidily with paths and hedgerows, correctly laid out to specification.  This hardly appears to be a nature scene, looking more like an architects idealized plans.

As I write this I can already hear the clamouring of critics upset at this taming of the wilderness and the loss of the diversity of it all.  My only response to this is that there is still plenty of chaos around.  This calming scene is temporary and may soon be replaced by the savagery of a winter storm and then, in time, replaced again by the exuberance and confusion of spring.  I say we should enjoy this moment of calm, marvel at the combination of nature and man's efforts that has brought it about and realize that these things are not to be taken for granted, but looked out for, worked for, and appreciated when they are found.

I enjoy energy, complexity and a touch of chaos, but in this mad swirl of life, as the dancers mingle and twirl and the miriad of forces around us push and shove this scene of apparent simplicity becomes very important.  Like the pause between drumbeats that creates a rhythm, this feels like a a deep, cleanising breath, reaching deep and sweeping the stale air out of my lungs.
</p>
<p>
I pause for a space of ten heartbearts, take this one deep breath, then plunge once more into the dance.
