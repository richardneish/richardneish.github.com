<h2>Believe</h2>
<p>
Believe in the work you do.<br>
Believe that it is important, that what you do makes life better for someone, somewhere.<br>
Believe that you are good at what you do.<br>
If you don't have these strongly held beliefs about the nature of yourself and your work, then you are doing the wrong thing.  You will be a happier person doing something else.  It also helps if you have evidence to back up these beliefs, but truth is overrated.<br>
