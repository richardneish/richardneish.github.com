WORK HOOKS OVERVIEW

    Work hooks are scattered throughout the backend code and allow a plugin
    to do work such as fetch data, alter the way Hastymail behaves, process
    forms, save settings, etc. NO OUTPUT is sent from these hooks, they all
    occur in the code before any XHTML is sent to the browser so an function
    associated with these hooks in a plugin must not echo or print anything.
    Some work hooks are page specific (such as only on the message view page),
    others run on all pages.  Available work hooks are listed in index.php.
    Removing a work hook from that array effectively disables any plugins
    use of it (not the entire plugin).

WORK HOOKS DETAIL

    The hooks are executed in the order that they appear here. To use a
    work hook add the hook name to the work_hooks section of the array defined
    the in the plugins config.php, create a file called work.php if it does
    not exist and add a function called <plugin name>_<work hook name>. This
    function will be executed when the hook point is reached in the main
    Hastymail code.


    Hook Name   Description

    init        Runs before any general GET or POST checks, but after we have
                determined the correct login status. This hook runs on every
                page load.

    first_time_login
                Runs once when a user logs into Hastymail for the first time.
                Just after this hook the user settings are saved for the first
                time. 

    on_login    runs just before the login form is processed. Plugins can alter the
                form by changing values in $_POST.
    just_logged_in
                Runs once when a user logs in after the basic user data is
                setup and before the first page specific logic is run.
