FROM RC6 to RC7
---------------

- Moved the filesystem_delim setting to the index.php file because we need to
  use it before we have access to the site config values. If you were using
  this option in the hastymail2.conf file you will need to set it to the correct
  delimiter in the main index.php file instead. The default is still "/"
- Expanded the alt_<nunmber> options in the configuration file to override any
  setting, not just IMAP related settings. This way different IMAP server logins
  can have different SMTP server settings, or different general settings.
- Added icons for the main menu to the buuf theme which requires templates, and
  the theme's entry in the hastymail2.conf file needs to be updated to the following:

    theme = buuf,true,true,true
