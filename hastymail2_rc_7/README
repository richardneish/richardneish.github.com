Hastymail2 does not use the script.aculo.us javascript libraries directly,
but makes compressed versions available through the plugin API. The Sajax
includes can be disabled and Hastymail2 will still function, but without
any AJAX functionality.

Installation instructions for Hastymail2 can be found in the INSTALL file.
Other documentation for Hastymail2 can be found in the docs/ directory.

Thank you for trying Hastymail2. We love feedback so let us know what you
think. You can find a list of ways to get in touch with us in the last
point of the Troubleshooting section of the INSTALL file, or you can send
me an email at jason@hastymail.org
