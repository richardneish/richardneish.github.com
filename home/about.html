<A NAME="Personal"></A>Personal Info</H2>
I am currently a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
In the Department of Computer Science.&nbsp; I am currently doing research
at the Center for Reliable and High-Performance Computing.&nbsp; Prior
to coming here I got my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Electronics from
the University of the West Indies, Mona Campus in Kingston Jamaica, where
I lived for the first 24 years of my life.&nbsp; Here are some of the important
things in my world:

<A NAME="UIUC"></A>UIUC / Champaign-Urbana</H2>
The University of Illinois has three main campuses, in Chicago, Springfield
and Champaign-Urbana.&nbsp; For historical reasons the Champaign-Urbana
campus is called the University of Illinois at&nbsp; <I>Urbana-Champaign</I>,
while the twin city region is typically referred to as Champaign-Urbana
(or Chambana, or Shampoo-Banana,...).&nbsp; The university boasts the second
largest university library system in the US, behind Harvard and the Department
of Computer Science here has long been associated with computing excellence.&nbsp;
As far as regional attractions go, the surrounding cornfields provide little
distraction from academic pursuits, a possible factor in the high standard
of work produced here over the years.

<P>I spend my days almost exclusively on the engineering campus, on the
northern part of the university.&nbsp; My lectures are held in the Digital
Computer Laboratory or in Everitt Hall.&nbsp; Outside of lectures I split
my time between coursework, research and my part-time job as system administrator
for the Image Formation and Processing Group and the Digital Signal Processing
Group.&nbsp; These groups have computer workstation labs in both the Computer
and Systems Research Laboratory and the Beckman Institute for Advanced
Science and Technology, where I have and office.&nbsp; My research is in
parallel programming techniques and my research advisor is Prof. Steven
Lumetta.

Ultimate</H3>
I am a semi-regular Ultimate player with the Men from Mars, the UIUC university
team.&nbsp; This sport, involving a frisbee and a vast amount of running,
is a pretty good way to keep in shape and have fun.

Other sports</H3>
I am a really bad, but enthusiastic, squash and racquetball player.&nbsp;
If you are looking for an opponent to wipe the court with, give me a call.&nbsp;
I also enjoy hiking and have tried skiing and snowboarding enough to know
that soft fluffy snow can hurt when you hit it going <I>really</I> fast.
