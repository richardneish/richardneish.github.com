<P>Public key algorithms use a different key for encryption and decryption,
and the decryption key cannot (practically) be derived from the encryption
key.  Public key methods are important because they can be used to transmit
encryption keys or other data securely even when the parties have no
opportunity to agree on a secret key in private.  All known methods are quite
slow, and they are usually only used to encrypt session keys (randomly
generated "normal" keys), that are then used to encrypt the bulk of the data
using a symmetric cipher (see below).</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI><A name="rsa"></A> <B>RSA</B> (Rivest-Shamir-Adelman) is the most commonly
used public key algorithm.  Can be used both for encryption and for signing. 
It is generally considered to be secure when sufficiently long keys are used
(512 bits is insecure, 768 bits is moderately secure, and 1024 bits is good). 
The security of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large integers. 
Dramatic advances in factoring large integers would make RSA vulnerable.  RSA
is currently the most important public key algorithm.  It is patented in the
United States (expires year 2000), and free elsewhere.
<P>For information on the recommended key lengths for RSA, see the <A
href="rsa-key-length-recommendations"> article by Bruce Schneier</A>. At
present, 512 bit keys are considered weak, 1024 bit keys are probably secure
enough for most purposes, and 2048 bit keys are likely to remain secure for
decades.</P>
<P>One should know that RSA is very vulnerable to <A
href="intro.html#chosen-plaintext"> chosen plaintext attacks</A>. There is
also a new <A href="intro.html#timing-attack"> timing attack</A> that can be
used to break many implementations of RSA.  The RSA algorithm is believed to
be safe when used properly, but one must be very careful when using it to
avoid these attacks.</P>
<P>Many implementations of RSA are freely available.  See e.g. <A
href="software.html#rsaref"> RSAREF </A>, <A href="software.html#rsaeuro">
RSAEURO</A>, <A href="software.html#ssleay">SSLeay</A>, <A

<LI><A name="diffie-hellman"></A> <B>Diffie-Hellman</B> is a commonly used
public-key algorithm for key exchange.  It is generally considered to be
secure when sufficiently long keys and proper generators are used.  The
security of Diffie-Hellman relies on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm
problem (which is believed to be computationally equivalent to factoring large
integers). Diffie-Hellman is claimed to be patented in the United States, but
the patent expires April 29, 1997.  There are also strong rumors that the
patent might in fact be invalid (there is evidence of it having been published
over an year before the patent application was wiled).
<P>Diffie-Hellman is sensitive to the choice of the strong prime and the
generator.  One possible prime/generator pair is suggested in the <A
href="ipsec/draft-ietf-ipsec-photuris-02.txt"> Photuris draft</A>. The size of
the secret exponent is also important for its security. Conservative advice is
to make the random exponent twice as long as the intended session key.</P>
<P>One should note the results presented in Brian A. LaMacchia and Andrew M.
Odlyzko, <A href="http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bal/"> Computation of Discrete
Logarithms in Prime Fields</A>, Designs, Codes and Cryptography 1 (1991),
47-62.  Basically, they conclude that by doing precomputations, it is possible
to compute discrete logarithms relative to a particular prime efficiently. 
The work needed for the precomputation is approximately equal or slightly
higher than the work needed for factoring a composite number of the same size.
 In practice this means that if the same prime is used for a large number of
exchanges, it should be larger than 512 bits in size, preferably 1024
bits.</P>
<P>There is also a new <A href="intro.html#timing-attack"> timing attack</A>
that can be used to break many implementations of Diffie-Hellman.</P>

<LI><A name="des"></A> <B>DES</B> is an algorithm developed in the 1970s.  It
was made a standard by the US government, and has also been adopted by several
other governments worldwide.  It is widely used, especially in the financial
industry.
<P>DES is a block cipher with 64-bit block size.  It uses 56-bit keys.  This
makes it fairly easy to break with modern computers or special-purpose
hardware.  DES is still strong enough to keep most random hackers and
individuals out, but it is easily breakable with special hardware by
government, criminal organizations, or major corporations.  In large volumes,
the cost of beaking DES keys is on the order of tens of dollars.  DES is
getting too weak, and should not be used in new designs.</P>
<P>A variant of DES, Triple-DES or <B>3DES</B> is based on using DES three
times (normally in an encrypt-decrypt-encrypt sequence with three different,
unrelated keys).  Many people consider Triple-DES to be much safer than plain
DES.</P>
<P>Implementations of DES can be found e.g. in the <A

<LI><A name="blowfish"></A> <B>Blowfish</B> is an algorithm developed by Bruce
Schneier.  It is a block cipher with 64-bit block size and variable length
keys (up to 448 bits).  It has gained a fair amount of acceptance in a number
of applications.  No attacks are known against it.  (Note: <A
href="blowfish-bug"> some implementations of blowfish contain a serious
implementation bug.</A>)
<P>Blowfish is used in a number of popular software packages, including
Nautilus and PGPfone.  Implementations of Blowfish can be found e.g. in the <A

<LI><A name="idea"></A> <B>IDEA</B> (International Data Encryption Algorithm)
is an algorithm developed at ETH Zurich in Switzerland.  It uses a 128 bit
key, and it is generally considered to be very secure.  It is currently one of
the best public known algorithms.  It is a fairly new algorithm, but it has
already been around for several years, and no practical attacks on it have
been published despite of numberous attempts to analyze it.
<P>IDEA is patented in the United States and in most of the European
countries.  The patent is held by Ascom-Tech.  Non-commercial use of IDEA is
free.  Commercial licenses can be obtained by contacting idea@ascom.ch.</P>
<P>Several implementations of IDEA are freely available.  See e.g. <A

<LI><A name="rc4"></A> <B>RC4</B> is a cipher designed by RSA Data Security,
Inc.  It used to be a trade secret, until someone posted source code for an
algorithm in Usenet News, claiming it to be equivalent to RC4.  There is very
strong evidence that the posted algorithm is indeed equivalent to RC4.  The
algorithm is very fast.  Its security is unknown, but breaking it does not
seem trivial either.  Because of its speed, it may have uses in certain
applications.  It can also accept keys of arbitrary length.  RC4 is
essentially a pseudo random number generator, and the output of the generator
is xored with the data stream.  For this reason, it is very important that the
same RC4 key never be used to encrypt two different data streams.
<P>Source code and information about RC4 can be found <A href="rc4"> here</A>
and in many cryptographic libraries, e.g. <A
href="software.html#ssleay">SSLeay</A>, <A
href="software.html#crypto++">Crypto++</A>, and <A
href="software.html#ssh">Ssh</A> source code.</P>
<P>The United States government routinely approves RC4 with 40 bit keys for
export.  Keys that are this small can be easily broken by governments,
criminals, and amateurs.</P>
<P>It is interesting to know that the exportable version of SSL (Netscape's
Secure Socket Layer), which uses RC4-40, was recently broken by at least two
independent groups.  Breaking it took about eight days; in many major
universities (or companies) the corresponding amount of computing power is
available to any computer science major.  More information about the incident
can be found on <A href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~doligez/ssl/">Damien

<LI><A name="safer"></A> <B>SAFER</B> is an algorithm developed by J. L.
Massey (one of the developers of IDEA).  A <A href="safer/safer_1.ps"> paper
describing it </A> was published recently.  It is claimed to provide secure
encryption with fast software implementation even on 8-bit processors.  Two
variants are available, one for 64 bit keys and the other for 128 bit keys.

<P></P>
<LI><B>Ciphers based on a hash function</B>.  Any cryptographically strong
hash function (see below) can be turned into a cipher.  There are several
possible arrangements; the general idea is that the hash function is used as a
random number generator, and the hash value is xored with the data to be
encrypted.  When all bytes of the hash value have been used, a new hash value
is obtained by modifying the key (or whatever was hashed) somehow, and taking
a hash of that.  The data to be hashed may include a key, the previous hash
value, a sequence number, previous plaintext, etc.
<P>An example of a hash-based cipher is MDC/SHA; code can be found e.g. in the
<A href="software.html#crypto++"> Crypto++ </A> library.</P>

<LI><A name="enigma"></A> <B>Enigma</B> was the cipher used by the Germans in
World War II. It is trivial to solve with modern computers; see the <A

used by the unix crypt(1) program, which should thus not be used.

<P></P>
<H2><A name="modes"> Block Cipher Modes </A></H2>
<P>Many commonly used ciphers (e.g., IDEA, DES, BLOWFISH) are block ciphers. 
This means that they take a fixed-size block of data (usually 64 bits), an
transform it to another 64 bit block using a function selected by the key. 
The cipher basically defines a one-to-one mapping from 64-bit integers to
another permutation of 64-bit integers.</P>
<P>If the same block is encrypted twice with the same key, the resulting
ciphertext blocks are the same (this method of encryption is called Electronic
Code Book mode, or <B>ECB</B>).  This information could be useful for an
attacker.</P>
<P>In practical applications, it is desirable to make identical plaintext
blocks encrypt to different ciphertext blocks.  Two methods are commonly used
for this:</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>CFB</B> mode: a ciphertext block is obtained by encrypting the previous
ciphertext block, and xoring the resulting value with the plaintext.
<LI><B>CBC</B> mode: a ciphertext block is obtained by first xoring the
plaintext block with the previous ciphertext block, and encrypting the
resulting value.
</UL>
<P>The previous ciphertext block is usually stored in an Initialization Vector
(IV).  An initialization vector of zero is commonly used for the first block,
though other arrangements are also in use.</P>

<LI><A name="md5"></A> <B>MD5</B> (Message Digest Algorithm 5) is a secure
hash algorithm developed at RSA Data Security, Inc.  It can be used to hash an
arbitrary length byte string into a 128 bit value.  MD5 is in wide use, and is
considered reasonable secure.
<P>However, some people have reported potential weaknesses in it, and "keyed
MD5" (typically used for authentication by having a shared secret, and
computing an authentication value by hashing first the secret (as a key), and
then the data to be hashed) has been reported to be broken.  It is also
reported that one could build a special-purpose machine costing a few million
dollars to find a plaintext matching given hash value in a few weeks.</P>

<H2><A name="random"> Random Number Generators </A></H2>
<P>Cryptographic systems need cryptographically strong random numbers that

generate session keys, and their quality is critical for the quality of the
resulting systems.  The random number generator is easily overlooked, and
becomes the weakest point of the system.</P>
<P>Some machines may have special purpose hardware noise generators. Noise
from the leak current of a diode or transistor, least significant bits of

randomness when processed with a suitable hash function.  It is a good idea to
acquire true environmental noise whenever possible.</P>
