<H1>Winter at UIUC</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="photo1.jpg">Photo 1</a> Home Sweet Home?  Note the icicles hanging from the doorway.  These grew until they reached the doorway and were broken off when the door opened.  Then, when it got a little warmer, we were treated to a shower of freezing droplets while standing in the doorway fumbling to get inside.</li>
<li><a href="photo2.jpg">Photo 2</a> The house next door.  The main subject of this photo and the next is the parked cars.  I would hate to be the owner of this particular car and return from vacation to have to dig myself out of this mess.  Particularly poignant is the fact that this car is registered in California, where presumably, your car being buried in snow is not such a common problem!</li>
<li><a href="photo3.jpg">Photo 3</a> Another parked car.  As of this writing, a week after the photo was taken, this car is still in the same state.  My guess is the owner has abandoned it.  Of course, it's possible they haven't found it. :-)</li>
<li><a href="photo4.jpg">Photo 4</a> The office (The Beckman Institute).  It is a pretty building isn't it.  Of course, it's on the other side of all that snow!  Worse yet, this isn't a heavily travelled part of campus, so the sidewalks are quite icy.  Makes you wonder just how badly you want to get to work...  The building on the right hand side of this shot is C&SRL, which was evacuated for a week due to snow and ice damage to the roof.  It's all better now, although the edge of the roof is held on with a big ugly brace until they can figure out how to make more permant repairs.</li>
