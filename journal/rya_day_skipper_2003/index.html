<h1>RYA Day Skipper course</h1>
<p>21.09.2003<br>
Joined "Solent 1" - Yamaha 33' at Souther Sailing School.  Dropped bags at school ~1300 left dock ~19:00.  Force 1, calm sea.  Moored alongside at Warsash, dinner then drinks @ The Rising Sun.  Fog in Hamble so stayed alongside.

First full day of course.  Up _8am at Warsash.  Showers, bfast etc, then caught 0840Z forecast at 0940BST followed later by imminent galse warning -&gt; hasty departure.</p>
<p>Headed up Southampton Water to Marshwood YC -&gt; mooring practice and theory work.  Glorious rainbow between showers.</p>

Bitterly cold overnight.  Up this morn to flat calm &amp; clear.  Engine trouble prevented us leaving the pontoon at Marshwood YC so bit of a wasted morning.  Finally sailed back to Southern Sailing boatyard in R. Itchen.  Away ~4pm to Cowes then up R. Medina  to Folly Inn.<br>
Sailing against / across time very frustrating.</p>

Folly Inn this morning.  COld morning with patches of mist rising from the water.  Took advantages of the facilities to get a much appreciated hot shower.  Later down river to Cowes for groceries and pontoon practice.  Then out and round to Newport River for navigation and brief anchor - very nice little anchorage.</p>
<p>Man overboard drills later, which were very disturbing, bringing back memories of St Ann's Head and John Carney.</p>
<p>Later on to moorings, to wait for suitable height of tide, then into Lymington Yacht Haven.  Am sunburnt and stuffed up with cold, but enjoying the course.  Early start tomorrow.</p>

Yet more engine trouble this morning delayed departure from Lymington.  Finally away ~ 12pm to fight the tide back to Southampton Water.  Did nav. exercises en route then up the Hamble to Warsash for pontoon practise &amp; diesel.  Then further up to Swanich Marina.  Tidied ship then dinner and drinks ashore.  So far we are all passing the course barring screw-ups tomorrow.  Personally I will have a bit of a sore head tomorrow morning given the drinking tonight but will be fine except for that.</p>
