  <h1>The maiden voyage of the yacht "Jovic"</h1>
  <h2>- La Rochelle, France to Las Palmas, Gran Canaria -</h2>

  <div>19/10/2000: Depart Jamaica, Air Jamaica flight JM001.  Kingston
  to MoBay was a fairly empty flight then people came on in MoBay to
  fill the flight.  Lovely kid in the row in front of me - obviously
  had enjoyed a good holiday and was heading home.  The lady next to
  me was a retired grandmother setting up a house in Montego Bay and
  returning to England.</div><div>
  Arrived Heathrow on time at 3pm, 21/10/2000.  By the time I had
  cleared the airport and got into London it was 6pm.  Ian Little met
  me at Leyton station and dropped me to his house but then had to
  head out.  Made a few calls to Robert, Vaniah and Julia, then went
  back into London to meet V.  Ended the evening at her (very nice)
  new apartment near Canary Wharf, then back to Leytonstone.
  </div>
  <hr width="30%" align="center">
  <div>
  22/10/2000: A slow start to the day, but headed into central London
  around noon to sort out coach tickets and generally wander.  I
  eventually made my way out to Wembley Park to catch up with Richild
  and Robert.  Richild was in UK for the weekend before returning to
  Luxembourg to finish a contract there.  Robert went off to Sunday
  dinner with family friends and Richild and I headed in to find
  Vaniah.  We again ended up in Vaniah's apartment dining on soup and
  pizza.  Unfortunately we stayed too late and missed the last train
  from Stratford.  Richild went off to find a taxi and I walked ~3
  miles back to Ian's place.
  </div>
  <hr width="30%" align="center">
  <div>
  23/10/2000: Having not spent any time catching up with Ian, I
  chatted briefly with him in the morning before he went off to work.
  I then packed up to leave.  Robert called and got directions to meet
  me at Leytonstone but unfortunately I had to leave before he
  arrived.  As it was, I arrived at Victoria Coach Station and stepped
  straight onto the Victoria-Plymouth coach.  An uneventful trip
  followed, ending with my arrival in Plymouth at 16:30 with time to
  kill.
  </div><div>
  I called Ellie, who turned out to be 1 1/2 hours away by car.  I
  wandered into main street Plymouth before meeting her at the coach
  station.  It was wonderful to see her again - she is such a great
  friend.
  </div><div>
  We made our way to the ferry port and found Robert Wilson, then
  headed into Plymouth to a pub in the Hoe, before heading back to the
  ferry port ~21:00.
  </div>
  <hr width="30%" align="center">
  <div>
  24/10/2000: The ferry crossing was uneventful and we arrived in
  Roscoff at 8:00 in pitch black.  The sun rose ~8:30 while we were en
  route to Morlaix by bus.  Morlaix to Rennes by train.  Rennes to
  Nantes by train.  Nantes to La Rochelle by train.  Arrived La
  Rochelle 15:45.  Painless trip, but a bit dull.  We decided to walk
  from the train station into La Rochelle Ville to find the boat.
  This took some doing as there are thousands of boats here.  Finally
  Vicky saw us and came over.  Harry was already aboard, having come
  on the morning train from Paris.
  </div>
  <hr width="30%" align="center">
  <div>
  25/10/2000: We spent Wednesday getting settled.  Bags were unpacked
  and stowed, the major functions of the boat were explained, etc.
  </div><div>
  Various Amel support people came aboard to fix the satphone and
  discuss issues to do with boat registration.
  </div><div>
  It also became clear that the shipment of boat supplies is missing.
  Last seen in Rotterdam on October 9th.
  </div>
  <hr width="30%" align="center">
  <div>
  26/10/2000: Various faxes and phone calls were made to try and
  locate the missing shipment.  We went into town for a look and found
  the market in the old town.  That afternoon Olivier took the boat
  out for a sail so we could see how things worked.  It was a lovely
  clear day.

  26/10/2000: We spent the morning touring the Amel factory.  A
  fascinating operation.  We saw 9 boats in various stages of
  production and a 10th just begun.
  </div><div>
  I wandered the town in the afternoon looking at a vast collection of
  boats including what looked like an Open 60.  The sailing here is
  fantastic, with fleets of dinghies, cats and sport boats operating
  out of a sailing school in our marina, Le Port des Minimes.  Every
  weekday there are classes and windsurfers out in the bay.

  27/10/2000: Friday.  Peter arrived and we heard that the mysterious
  shipment had arrived in La Rochelle and would be cleared on Monday.
  </div>
  <hr width="30%" align="center">
  <div>
  28/10/2000: There are loads of races going on.  People seem to
  arrive here on Friday night and spend the weekend sailing.  There
  are groups of mobile homes by the dinghy park and the cruisers have
  been streaming out as well.
  </div><div>
  The day dawned blustery with ~20 kts of wind and overcast skies.  I
  went with Harry, John and Vicky to the chandlers and to the
  Carrefour (a huge supermarket).  On our return a 45kt squall with
  rain swept across the harbour.  The breeze kept up after this
  squall, settling at 25kts from the North-NorthWest.
  </div>
  <hr width="30%" align="center">
  <div>
  29/10/2000: Harry, Peter, Robert and I drove 100 km to Les Sables de
  Olonne to look at the Vendee Globe racers.  There were huge crowds
  viewing the 24 entrants and the adjacent sponsors exhibit hall.
  These non-stop round the world racers depart Les Sables de Olonne
  on 5/11/2000, heading for the southern ocean.  Expected race
  duration is just over 100 days.
  </div><div>
  We returned to find that the breeze was still blowing although it
  had shifted slightly to the West and South of West.  It continued to
  blow steadily throughout the night.

  30/11/2000 Today (Monday).  The barometer has fallen to 995
  millibars and the wind has not been below 20kts occasionally
  gusting to 45kts, from the SouthWest.  No sign of the shipment yet,
  or of the professional skipper, who was due to arrive yesterday.
  </div><div>
  As of 18:00 the breeze had not abated.  Pressure was rising however
  and I was hopeful for improved weather in the morning.
  </div>
  <hr width="30%" align="center">
  <div>
  31/10/2000: Woke up with a sore head from a night out.  Clear blue
  sky with light breeze West-SouthWest.  Headed into town on foot via
  the Maritime Museum.  A round the world boat "Joshua" is on display
  here as are "Pen Duick II" and "Pen Duick V".  Started to rain at
  this point so we had to seek shelter.
  </div><div>
  The forecast for the next few days is bad and tomorrow is a holiday
  (All Saints Day) so departure has been pushed back.  ETD is now
  Saturday and I am getting very frustrated.  I am tempted to head
  back to Paris to see Nora or to Edinborough to see Julia.  Hopefully
  we will get moving.

  <div>
  2/11/2000: Yesterday was All Saints Day - a public holiday here.  As
  expected the breeze filled in, with occasional rain squalls.  We are
  reasnably comfortable at dock but it is probably best not to
  consider venturing out until this passes.  The boat is largely ready
  to depart although the official registration papers are not here,
  the boat has not yet been provisioned and the compass must be
  recalibrated.
  </div><div>
  Once this is all done and the weather becomes favourable we can
  finally get underway.  The ennui of sitting around for days on end
  resulted in an epic night out yesterday.  Starting at 10pm with Le
  Jam - African Rhythms.  We closed this first bar at 2am then went
  into town with a bartender there - Fab was his name.  The 5 of us -
  Fab, Peter, Harry, Robert and I - piled into Fab's car and wandered
  into La Rochelle Ville to a small private club.  We were the last to
  leave there as well, at 5am in search of coffee and croissants.
  Harry and I walked back to the boat while the others drove,
  eventually getting croissants by knocking on bakery doors at 5am!
  After a good sleep I am ready to repeat this again tonight.
  </div>
  <hr width="30%" align="center">
  <div>
  3/11/2000: 10:00 - We have got the disappointing news that we will
  be here at least 3 more days waiting for a break in the weather.
  This is pushing back our arrival date in the Canries as well and I
  may be forced to leave the boat when we get to Spain.  In the
  meantime I am casting around for something to do this weekend.  I
  will call Nora in Paris and go to visit her.
  </div><div>
  3/11/2000: 21:00 - I
  have just spoken to Nora who is leaving Paris for the weekend.  This
  confirms that I will be staying here until we leave whenever that
  is.  Nora asked if I was bored with La Rochelle.  I would have to
  say yes - and no.  The forced solitude of being a visitor in a land
  where I do not speak the language has forced me into some not
  unpleasant introspection.  Yes I am understimulated, but it is quite
  peaceful here.  The lashings of rain and breeze would seem to be a
  hardship, but they suit my mood.  Enduring hardship gives me
  strength and perserverance and familiarity with my environs has
  given them a certain inner beauty.  The desolate sea wall, the harsh
  lights on the green-brown soup of the marina waters, the low
  scudding clouds - these are a comfort and a familiar backdrop.
  Outside the marina the protected bay offers a deceptively calm
  invitation yet beyond that the Bay of Biscay beckons, with its sure
  promise of discomfort.  Beyond that I know not what.  Most likely a
  hurried arrival in Las Palmas followed by a flight to England and
  back home to an environment I have started to forget.  This prospect
  of return is a disquieting one.  There were many things I left
  undone when I departed.  I do not know which would be worse - to
  face recrimination for my shortcomings, or to find that they are
  only significant to me.  Only time will tell and there are many
  miles to travel before then.

  4/11/2000: La Rochelle Ville. Port Les Minimes. 46 degrees 08.809
  minutes N, 1 degree 09.999 minutes W.
  </div>
  <div>
  The 5 day forecast is grim.  Good weather today but not tomorrow.
  Through Monday is predicted to be horrible, force 9 to 10 winds.
  </div><div>
  This morning began clear and warm with winds under 10 knots.
  Gradually clouds have filled in but the barometer has not yet begun
  to fall.  We went for a shakedown sail and the boat handles well
  given enough breeze although she struggles to go to weather and
  occassionally kicks up spray over the bow.  We did not get a chance
  to see her response to swell - that will have to wait until the
  journey begins.
  </div><div>
  Our plans are, as ever, in flux.  The latest proposal is to take on
  the final member of our crew here and set sail directly for Las
  Palmas to save time.  We will not take the professional skipper with
  us in this case and will not stop unless needeed.  Even so it
  appears unlikely that we will make it to the Canaries before the
  14th or 15th.  I am booked to leave London on the 19th, so I will
  probably have to leave Las Palmas as soon as we arrive or change my
  flight.  This has become a horribly wasted trip and I will have to
  consider carefully before I go on this kind of delivery trip.  I
  will enjoy it, I'm sure, but it is keeping me away from
  responsibilities that I have not been able or willing to put aside.
  </div><div>
  I should not be overly concerned.  Harry and Peter are under similar
  pressure and those who are staying with the boat would like to reach
  Las Palmas in time to resupply and start the ARC on the 19th, so we
  will all be pulling together to make the best possible time.

  6/11/2000: Yesterday was spent in a state of limbo.  The predicted
  gales have hit and the barometer has dropped as the winds rose.  The
  sky has been filled with scudding clouds so low it seemed as though
  you could reach up and touch them, scratching the scaly belly of the
  dragon while listening to his howling breath.
  </div><div>
  Today is expected to be much the same.  There is as yet no sign of
  the workers expected to arrive to configure the navigation and
  communication systems and I feel that this is yet another delay
  thrown in our path.  We sit here doubled lines all round and wait
  and wait and wait.
  </div><div>
  ~19:30.  This incredibly shitty day rolls on.  The Vendee Globe
  racers have postponed their start, 35 miles North, because of the
  bad conditions.  12 metre waves have been reported in the Bay of
  Biscay and the conditions may not be substantially improved before
  Thursday.  I am seriously considering packing it in and going back
  to UK.  I will have to get into town early tomorrow to check my mail
  and see what my options are.
  </div>
  <hr width="30%" align="center">
  <div>
  8/11/2000: We are to set sail tomorrow at 6am to get out before low
  tide.  All the preparations have been made and bills paid and it
  looks like it will actually happen this time.  I have been in La
  Rochelle for 15 days and will not miss the place.
  </div><div>
  It will probably be an uncomfortable trip, but moving forward -
  regardless of the effort - is infinitely better that standing still.
  </div><div>
  I have not said any goodbyes.  I should have called my parents, to
  tell them I love them, Susy to tell her I will be back soon, and
  Julia to say I hope to see her soon.  As usual I am too busy talking
  to myself to reach out and say what I feel to the people I love.
  Anyway, we have an early start.  The forcast is for low winds dying
  further in the next 36 hours but the seas are expected to be rough
  and I will not be surprised to be cold and wet.  Thank God we are
  finally moving.

  1314UTC 10/11/2000.  44 degrees 54.468 minutes N, 5 degrees 28.400
  minutes W.  Course 247 degrees M, Speed 6.5 kts.  We set off from La
  Rochelle at dawn (4:50 UTC) yesterday.  Dawn, swells, seagulls,
  seasick, dusk, seasick, swells, squalls, cold, dolphins, 9kts
  boatspeed, better, dawn in the sleeping bag, sun, sun, sun, flat
  seas motorsailing to Spain.

  <div>
  2156UTC 10-11-2000. 44 degrees 26.879 minutes N, 6 degrees 36.496
  minutes W.  Motor, motor, motor.  No useful breeze all day, but we
  seem to be getting some assistance from the sails now.  The calm
  conditions have helped me get over my seasickness, but I will have
  to cautious if we encounter any rough stuff.  Apart from that we
  plod on fighting tedium and getting there, minute by minute.
  </div><div>
  I am working my way through a list of navigation systems that still
  need tweaking and integrating, but this is as much to keep busy as
  anything else.
  </div>
  <hr width="30%" align="center">
  <div>
  18:17UTC 12/11/2000. 42 degrees 37.236 minutes N, 10 degrees 17.451
  minutes W.  I have lost track of time.  We are finally moving well
  againafter slowing down to let bad weather through.  We are now
  clear of the Bay of Biscay, on course for Las Palmas with 900
  nautical miles to go.
  </div>
  <hr width="30%" align="center">
  <div>
  13:55 13-11-2000. 40 degrees 20.502 minutes N, 11 degrees 25.046
  minutes W.  Progress continues.  The boat has been sailing well all
  last night and today.  The crew at last appears to be fully rested
  and adapted to life on board.  As mentioned previously I have lost
  all track of time.  I am told that today is Monday, but the word
  holds no relevance here.
  </div><div>
  The attitude on board is to keep going as fast as confortable and to
  deal with onward travel plans when we arrive at Las Palmas.  Making
  plans before then serves no purpose since we are still very much at
  the whim of wind and sea.  Conditions now are good, but the
  boatspeed has dropped from its highs overnight.
  </div>

  <div>
  2107 13-11-2000.  39 degrees 33.839 minutes N, 11 degrees 51.497
  minutes W.  Just overheard a conversation between QE2 and an
  unidentified Vendee Globe boat.  He reports that one of the racers
  has dropped out with a broken mast.
  </div><div>
  As for us, we charge south, making good speed on a direct course for
  Las Palmas.  Steady speeds of 7kts with surges in the squalls.  As I
  write this we have just seen 10.5kts in a cloudburst.  Onward.
  </div>
  <hr width="30%" align="center">
  <div>
  1436 14-11-2000.  37 degrees 34.587 minutes N, 12 degrees 34.270
  minutes W.  Caught a fish about an hour ago.  It looks like about an
  8lb tuna which I have landed, cleaned and gutted and Harry has
  offered to cook for dinner.  Everyone is in good spirits and we roll
  generally south.
  </div><div>
  The breeze prevents the direct course to the Canaries at the moment
  but we are still making good speed in approximately the right
  direction.  If there is no change in the next 24 hours we will have
  to think about jibing to get further East but right now we are happy
  on this heading (about 230 degrees).

  1946UTC 15-11-2000. 34 degrees 24.911 minutes N, 13 degrees 49.637
  minutes W.  Finally got the ballooner up this afternoon and we are
  on a direct course and making reasonable time.  Sally was right when
  she said the worst part of long distances was finding something to
  pass the time.  I'm ready to go home now.  Still 400+ miles to go so
  we will have to fight tedium for a while yet.  This cruising rig
  boasts simplicity but it removes the simple tasks like sail trim and
  hand steering that we have been using to pass time when on watch.
  </div>
  <hr width="30%" align="center">
  <div>
  1416UTC 16-11-2000.  32 degrees 17.828 minutes N, 14 degrees 19.248
  minutes W.  It seems that we may finish this trip the same way it
  began, motoring in insufficient breeze.  This is mostly to ensure a
  timely arrival since we could probably ghost along at 5kts under
  sail, but it is also more comfortable to motor with the sea coming
  from behind.
  </div><div>
  There is a significant list of things to be done upon arrival in Las
  Palmas both by those leaving and by the crew who will be doing the
  transAtlantic leg so expect the shipboard tupour to be very sharply
  disturbed.

  21/11/2000: Apparently, breaking the 200nm barrier means you stop

  </div><div>
  With Las Palmas looming ever closer the shipboard routine changed
  hour by hour.  First it was "the last night watch", then "the last
  dawn", then get the luggage out, start sorting in preparation for
  packing.
  </div><div>
  No sign of land when I went off watch.  A few hours later Harry
  announced "Land Ho".  It takes a bit of immagination but we can just
  make out the hills in the haze.
  </div><div>
  As night fell the lights became visible.  We got ever closer and
  then began picking our way through the ships and into the marina.
  Finally lines ashore and tied off at 2140UTC 17/11/2000, 1500 miles
  travelled since La Rochelle.
  </div><div>
  After a few drinks and rounds of photos Robert and I headed ashore,
  followed shortly by the rest.  I got the guided tour of the marina
  and adjoining beach which Robert knows all too well from his last
  stay in Las Palmas.  Then we met his old skipper from ARC99, Petar
  and had a chat and a drink.  Eventually that bar closed so Robert,
  Peter, Harry and I went a short way into town to the ARC party where
  a good time was had by all.
  </div><div>
  Up bright and early on Saturday for a whirlwind of activity.  Jovic
  was assigned a berth, then while John went to Check in at the ARC
  office, the safety officer gave Jovic the once over.  Then we moved
  to the new berth all the wall with artwork done by previous ARC
  entrants.  Peter and I headed into town and booked tickets out then
  went back to the boat, picked up luggage and said goodbyes and
  headed to the airport.
  </div><div>
  I don't know if the trip to the airport is representative of Gran
  Canaria, but it was a half-hour journey across the surface of the
  moon.  A bare, dry, blasted landscape where the most prevalent
  feature is precarious slopes of gravel and grey-brown scree as far
  as the eye can see.  What little agriculture there was was swathed
  in plastic to keep the moisture in and the dust out and the tunnel
  we drove through is a testament to the rugged nature of the land.
  We flew from Las Plamas to madrid and then from Madrid to London
  arriving there at 21:30.  Checked into the Heathrow Rennaissance
  (very nice) and spent the night before returning to the airport to
  spend the entire day getting back here.  It's fun to travel but it
  is nice to be back home again.
