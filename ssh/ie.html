This is a demo of MindTerm with ISNetworks' SCP modifications running as an applet.
IE will give you a warning that it does not trust the certificate used to sign
the code because IE does not have the ISNetworks Root CA installed as a trusted CA.
In order to do SCP file transfers the applet will need access to the local file system
and the SSH/SCP server, and therefore asks for the necessary permissions.
