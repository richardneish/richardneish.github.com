  <title>Demo of MindTerm as a signed applet</title>
</head>
<body>
<br>
This is a demo of MindTerm with ISNetworks' SCP modifications running as an applet.
Netscape will not accept the signed applet unless you trust the ISNetworks Root CA.
You can install that certificate by clicking <a href="ISNetworksCA.cacert">here</a>
if this web server has the .cacert MIME type mapped to application/x-x509-ca-cert or
from <a href="http://www.isnetworks.com/ssh/ISNetworksCA.cacert">ISNetworks' site</a>.
You'll need to trust the cert for signing software and then restart Netscape for the
permissions to take effect.
<br>
In order to do SCP file transfers the applet will need access to the local file system
and the SSH/SCP server, and therefore asks for the necessary permissions.
