I can't comment on that particular concoction, but this week a
cow-orker brought in some LN2 and we made various flavors of ice
cream, one of which was my Guinness flavored attempt. It got high
praise all around. Recipe follows:

The Guinness Ice Cream was based off of a recipe I got from
rec.food.cooking in a thread about "incompatible foods":

16 ounces Guinness stout
2 cups heavy cream
2 cups whole milk
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 vanilla bean, split in half lengthwise
6 egg yolks

In a large saucepan, simmer the Guinness until reduced by 3/4 in
volume, about 8-10 minutes. Cover and refrigerate.

Combine the cream, milk, and sugar in a medium, heavy saucepan. Scrape
the seeds from the vanilla bean into the pan and add the vanilla bean
halves. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat.

Beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Slowly whisk 1 cup of the hot
cream into the egg yolks. Gradually add the egg mixture in a slow,
steady stream, to the hot cream. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring
occasionally, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a
spoon and reaches 170 degrees F. on an instant-read thermometer, about
5 minutes. Remove from the heat and strain through a fine mesh
strainer into a clean container.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing
down against the surface to keep a skin from forming. Chill in the
refrigerator for at least 2 hours.

Remove from refrigerator and add the Guinness reduction, whisking
until well blended. Pour into the bowl of an ice cream machine and
freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to an
airtight container and freeze until ready to serve.
