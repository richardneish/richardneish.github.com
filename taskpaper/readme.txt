======Taskpaper.web======

A simple, easy to use plain text file-based task management web application.
It offers superb ways of filtering, grouping, searching for and managing your tasks.
But ultimately 'all you tasks belong you', so everything is stored in a straight forward text file format.
Tasks are created and edited directly in the text file, either in the application or in an editor of your choice.
