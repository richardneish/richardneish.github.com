<h1>Taskpaper.web</h1>
<p>A simple, easy to use plain text file-based task management web
application. It offers superb ways of filtering, grouping, searching
for and managing your tasks. But ultimately 'all your tasks belong you',
so everything is stored in a simple text file format. Tasks
are created and edited directly in the text file, either in the
application or in an editor of your choice.

<h2>The Taskpaper Syntax</h2>
<h4>Projects</h4>
<p>Projects are created by writing the project name on a line followed by a colon ( : )
    <pre>This is a project:</pre>
</p>
<h4>Tasks</h4>
<p>You make a task by beginning the line with dash-space ( - &nbsp;)
    <pre>- this is a task</pre>
</p>
<h4>Tags</h4>
<p>No task management is complete without ubiquitious 'tags', a quick, simple way of group and filtering your tasks.&nbsp;
A tag is added by putting a @ symbol before the tag word
    <pre>- this is a task @tag @another-tag</pre>
</p>
<p><em>(Note: sorry, no spaces allowed in tags...you'll get used to it!)</em></p>
<h4>Dated Tags</h4>
<p>You an also make a dated tag (i.e. a due date) by using the @ followed by the date
    <pre>- a dated tasks @15-dec-2009</pre>
</p>
<p><em>(Note: the date format default is dd-mmm-yyyy, but this can be changed in the config.php file)</em></p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Any line beginning with ... (an ellipsis) is considered as a note. Simple as that. &nbsp;Notes belong to the task above them
    <pre>...a note all by itself</pre>
</p>
<h4>Complete/Done</h4>
<p>To show that a task is done, just put an X at the start of the line. &nbsp;Simple, visible, memorable!
    <pre>X- this task is done</pre>
</p>
<h4>Highlighting/Starred</h4>
<p>To highlight a task (aka: starred) you can simply put an * (asterisk) at the end of the line
    <pre>- this task is highlighted*<br></pre>
</p>
<h4>Other points worth noting:</h4>
<p>It's usually best to leave a blank line between projects, it makes it easier to recognise the
different projects. &nbsp;At the top of the list is a good place to
put any new (orphaned) tasks that you haven't had time to
file yet. &nbsp;As noted below tasks entered in the 'Search Box' also puts
new tasks here by default. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Adding and Editing Tasks</h2>
<p>You can edit the whole taskpaper document by clicking the <strong>'Edit'</strong>
button on the toolbar at the top; make any edits you want and click <strong>'Save'</strong>
button when you're finished. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also quickly add new tasks using the <strong>'Search/Command Box'</strong> at
the top right. &nbsp;Just type a task as you normally would (i.e.
start with '- ') and press enter when you're done. &nbsp;You can
also add tags, or even choose the project by typing <strong>'/'</strong>
followed by the project number (Refer to the project numbers in list on left) or
by selecting a project before you enter a new task. &nbsp;By
default all new tasks added this way will be put at the top if no project is given.</p>
<p>You can also use time periods in tags when adding tasks through the Command Box; for example
if you type "@today" it will be changed to today's date when the task is added.
The following time periods are recognised:
    <pre>@today, @tomorrow, @day, @week, @month, @year</pre>
</p>
<p>Before the last 4 periods you can also put a number, e.g:
    <pre>@2day, @3week (i.e. in 2 days, in 3 weeks)</pre>
</p>
<p><em>Note: spaces and plurals are not recognised (yet...)</em></p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>So, to put it all together here's a complete example:
<pre>The first project:
- get to work early @remind @important *
- get to bed early @maybe
X- buy flowers for your wife @remind @30-dec-2009

Second project:
- wake up early @soon
- eat wholemeal porridge @food @today*
...try Tiger Oats?</pre>
</p>
<h2>Group, Filter, Search</h2>
<p>Click on any tag, anywhere to
filter/group by that tag. &nbsp;Same thing for projects; click on
the project heading to see tasks from that project only.</p>
<p>Use the search box on the top right to do a full-text search, multiple words can be used. &nbsp;
Words can be excluded by putting '-' before them:
    <pre>yes -no</pre>
</p>
<p>You can also search by date:
    <pre>&gt;12-feb-2009 =&gt; all tasks after this date</pre>
    <pre>&lt;12-jan-2008 =&gt; all tasks before this date</pre>
    <pre>"12-jan-2009 12-feb-2009" =&gt; all tasks between these dates</pre>
    <pre>12-feb-2009..30-may-2009 =&gt; (alternative way of doing date ranges)</pre>
</p>
<p>Or by time period: any of the following are accepted and understood:
    <pre> =today, =week, =month, =quarter, =year</pre>
</p>
<p>Use the special <strong>'done', 'starred', 'due', 'late'</strong> tags to filter by these categories.</p>
<p>Of course you can also use these tags in the Search Box too:
    <pre>=due, =late, =star, =done</pre>
</p>
<p>You can search for specific phrases by enclosing them in quotes (" "):
    <pre>"specific phrase"</pre>
</p>
<p>All the above can be combined in one search as well, e.g.:
    <pre>=due order "door hinges"</pre>
</p>
<p>Taskpaper will try to sort and group date searches by month for a better overview. &nbsp;
If your search contains many words, commands and/or dates, then put the date at the end to group the search.
For example these searches would be grouped:
    <pre>roof =month</pre>
    <pre>joe door =due</pre>
</p>
<p>These searches will not be grouped:
    <pre>=month order</pre>
    <pre>=due electrical</pre>
</p>
