<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><!--BEG_E3-->MS Fnd in a Lbry<BR><BR>HAL DRAPER<BR><BR>From: Report of the Commander, Seventh Expeditionary Force, <BR>      Andromedan Paleoanthropological Mission<BR> <BR>What puzzled our research teams was the suddenness of collapse<BR>and the speed of reversion to barbarism, in this multigalactic <BR>civilization of the biped race.  Obvious causes like war, destruction, <BR>plague, or invasion were speedily eliminated.  Now the outlines of the <BR>picture emerge, and the answer makes me apprehensive.<BR><BR>Part of the story is quite similar to ours, according to those who <BR>know our own prehistory well.<BR><BR>On the mother planet there are early traces of *books*. This word <BR>denotes paleoliterary records of knowledge in representational and <BR>macroscopic form.  Of course, these disappeared very early, perhaps <BR>175,000 of our yukals ago, when their increase threatened to leave <BR>no place on the planet's surface for anything else.<BR><BR>First they were reduced to *micros*, and then to *supermicros*,<BR>which were read with the primeval electronic microscopes then extant. <BR>But in another yukal the old problem was back, aggravated by colonization <BR>on most of the other planets of the local Solar System, all of which were <BR>producing *books* in torrents.  At about this time, too, their cumbersome <BR>alphabet was reduced to mainly consonantal elements (thus: thr cmbrsm alfbt <BR>w rdsd t mnl cnsntl elmnts) but this was done to facilitate quick reading, <BR>and only incidentally did it cut down the mass of Bx (the new spelling) <BR>by a full third. A drop out of the bucket.<BR><BR>Next step was the elimination of the multitude of separate Bx <BR>depositories in favor of a single building for the whole civilization. <BR>Every home on every inhabited planet had a farraginous diffuser which <BR>tuned in on any of the Bx at will. This cut the number to about one <BR>millionth at a stroke, and the wise men of the species congratulated <BR>themselves that the problem was solved.<BR><BR>This building, twenty-five miles square and two miles high, was buried <BR>in one of the oceans to save land surface for parking space, and so our <BR>etymological team is fairly sure that the archaic term liebury (Ibry) dates <BR>from this period.  Within no more than twenty-two yukals, story after story <BR>had been added till it extended a hundred miles into the stratosphere. <BR>At this level, cosmic radiation defarraginated the scanning diffusers, <BR>and it was realized that another limit had been reached.  Proposals were <BR>made to extend the liebury laterally, but it was calculated that in three <BR>yukals of expansion so much of the ocean would be thus displaced that the <BR>level of the water would rise ten feet and flood the coastal cities. <BR>Another scheme was worked out to burrow deeper into the ocean bottom, <BR>until eventually the liebury would extend right through the planet like <BR>a skewer through a shashlik (a provincial Plutonian delicacy), but it <BR>was realized in time that this would be only a momentary palliative.<BR><BR>The fundamental advance, at least in principle, came when the <BR>representational records were abandoned altogether in favor of *punched <BR>supermicros*, in which the supermicroscopic elements were the punches <BR>themselves.  This began the epoch of abstract recs - or Rx, to use the <BR>modern term.<BR><BR>The great breakthrough came when Mcglcdy finally invented mass-<BR>produced *punched molecules* (of any substance).  The mass of Rx <BR>began shrinking instead of expanding.  Then Gidbg proved what had <BR>already been suspected; knowledge was not infinite, and the civilization <BR>was asymptotically approaching its limits; the flood was leveling off. <BR>The Rx storage problem was hit another body-blow two generations later <BR>when Kwlsk used the Mcglcdy principle to develop the *notched electron*, <BR>made available for use by the new retinogravitic activators.  In the ensuing <BR>ten yukals a series of triumphant developments wiped the problem out for <BR>good, it seemed:<BR><BR>(1) Getting below matter level, Shmt began by notching quanta (an obvious<BR>extension of Kwlsk's work) but found this clumsy.  In a brilliant stroke he<BR>invented the *chipped quantum*, with an astronomical number of chips on each<BR>one.  The Rx contracted to one building for the whole culture.<BR><BR>(2) Shmt's pupil Qjt, even before the master's death, found the chip <BR>unnecessary.  Out of his work, ably supported by Drnt and Lccn, came the <BR>*nudged quanta*, popularly so called because a permanent record was impressed <BR>on each quantum by a simple vectorial pressure, occupying no subspace on the <BR>pseudo-surface itself.  A whole treatise could be nudged onto a couple of <BR>quanta, and whole branches of knowledge could for the first time be put <BR>in a nutshell.  The Rx dwindled to one room of one building.<BR><BR>(3) Finally - but this took another yukal and was technologically <BR>associated with the expansion of the civilization to intergalactic <BR>proportions - Fx and Sng found that quanta in hyperbolic tensor systems <BR>could be tensed into occupying the same spatial and temporal coordinates, <BR>if properly pizzicated.  In no time at all, a quantic pizzicator was <BR>devised to compress the nudged quanta into overlapping spaces, most of <BR>these being arranged in the wide-open areas lying between the outer electrons <BR>and the nucleus of the atom, leaving the latter free for tables of contents, <BR>illustrations, graphs, etc.<BR><BR>All the Rx ever produced could now be packed away in a single drawer, with<BR>plenty of room for additions.  A great celebration was held when the Rx drawer<BR>was ceremoniously installed, and glowing speeches pointed out that science<BR>had once more refuted pessimistic croakings of doom.  Even so, two speakers<BR>could not refrain from mentioning certain misgivings . . .<BR> <BR>To understand the nature of these misgivings, we must now turn to a develop-<BR>ment which we have deliberately ignored so far for the sake of simplicity but<BR>which was in fact going on side by side with the shrinking of the Rx.<BR><BR>First, as we well know, the Rx in the new storage systems could be scanned<BR>only by activating the nudged or pizzicated quanta, etc., by means of a code<BR>number, arranged as an index to the Rx.  Clearly the index itself had to be <BR>kept representational and macroscopic, else a code number would become <BR>necessary to activate *it*.  Or so it was assumed.<BR><BR>Secondly, a process came into play of which even the ancients had had<BR>presentiments.  According to a tradition recorded by Kchv among some <BR>oldsters in the remote Los Angeles swamps, the thing started when an antique<BR>sage produced one of the paleoliterary Bx entitled *An Index to Indexes* (or<BR>*Ix t Ix*), coded as a primitive I2.  By the time of the supermicros there were<BR>several Indexes to Indexes to Indexes (I3), and work had already started on<BR>an I4.<BR><BR>These were the innocent days before the problem became acute.  Later, <BR>Index runs were collected in Files, and Files in Catalogs --- so that, <BR>for example, C3F5I4 meant that you wanted an Index to Indexes to Indexes <BR>to Indexes which was to be found in a certain File of Files of Files of <BR>Files of Files, which in turn was contained in a Catalog of Catalogs <BR>of Catalogs.  Of course, actual numbers were much greater.  This structure <BR>grew exponentially.  The process of education consisted solely in learning <BR>how to tap the Rx for knowledge when needed.  The position was well put <BR>indeed in a famous speech by Jzbl to the graduates of the Central Saturnian <BR>University, when he said that it was a source of great pride to him that <BR>although hardly anybody knew anything any longer, everybody now knew how <BR>to find out everything.<BR><BR>Another type of Index, the Bibliography, also nourished, side by side with<BR>the C-F-I series of the Ix.  This B series was the province of an aristocracy of<BR>scholars who devoted themselves exclusively to Bibliographies of Bibliogra-<BR>phies of... well, at the point in history with which we are next concerned,<BR>the series had reached B437.  Furthermore, at every exponential level, some<BR>ambitious scholar branched off to a work on a History of the Bibliographies<BR>of that level.  The compilation of the first History of Bibliography (H1) <BR>is lost in the mists of time, but there is an early chronicled account of <BR>a History of Bibliographies of Bibliographies of Bibliographies (H3) and <BR>naturally H436 was itself under way about the time B437 was completed.<BR><BR>On the other hand, the first History of Histories of Bibliographies came<BR>much later, and this H-prime series always lagged behind.  It goes without<BR>saying that the B-H-H series (like the C-F-I series) had to have its own <BR>indexes, which in turn normally grew into a C-F-I series ancillary to the <BR>B-H-H series.  There were some other but minor developments of the sort.<BR><BR>All these Index records were representational; though proposals were made<BR>at times to reduce the whole thing to pizzicated quanta, reluctance to take <BR>this fateful step long won out.  So when the Rx had already shrunk to room size,<BR>the Ix were expanding to fill far more than the space saved.  The old liebury<BR>was bursting. One of the asteroids was converted into an annex, called the<BR>Asteroidal Storage Station.  In thirteen yukals, all the ASS's were filled in the<BR>original Solar System.  Other systems selfishly refused to admit the camel's nose<BR>into their tent.<BR><BR>Under the stress of need, resistance to abstractionizing broke, and with the<BR>aid of the then new process of cospatial nudging, the entire mass of Ix was<BR>nudged into a drawer no bigger than that which contained the Rx themselves.<BR><BR>Now this drawer (D1) itself had to be activated by indexed code numbers.<BR>More and more scholars turned away from research in the thinner and thinner<BR>stream of discoverable knowledge in order to tackle the far more serious<BR>problem: how to thread one's way from the Ix to the Rx. This specialization<BR>led to a whole new branch of knowledge known as Ariadnology. Naturally,<BR>as Ariadnology expanded its Rx, its Ix swelled proportionately, until it <BR>became necessary to set up a subbranch to systematize access from the Ix <BR>to the Rx of Ariadnology itself. This (the Ariadnology of Ariadnology) <BR>was known as A2, and by the time of the Collapse the field of A5 was just <BR>beginning to develop, together with its appropriate Ix, plus the indispensable <BR>B-H-H series, of course.<BR><BR>The inevitable happened in the course of a few yukals: The Ix of the second<BR>code series began to accumulate in the same ASS's that had once been so<BR>joyfully emptied. Soon these Ix were duly abstractionized into a second<BR>drawer, D2.<BR><BR>Then it was the old familiar story: The liebury filled up, the ASS's filled up.<BR>Around 10,000 yukals ago, the first artificial planet was created, therefore, to<BR>hold the steadily mounting agglomeration of Ix drawers.  About 8000 yukals<BR>ago, a number of artificial planets were united into pseudosolar systems<BR>for convenience.  By the time of yukal 2738 of our own era (for we are now<BR>getting into modern times), the artificial pseudosolar systems were due to be<BR>amalgamated into a pseudogalaxy of drawers, when - the Catastrophe<BR>struck . . .<BR><BR><BR>This tragic story can be told with some historical detail, thanks to <BR>the work of our research teams.<BR><BR>It began with what seemed a routine breakdown in one of the access lines<BR>from D57x103 to D42x107.  A Bibliothecal Mechanic set out to fix it as usual. <BR>It did not fix.  He realized that a classification error must have been made <BR>by the ariadnologist who had worked on the last pseudosolar system. Tracing <BR>the misnudged quanta involved, he ran into:<BR><BR>"See C11F73I15."<BR><BR>Laboriously tracing through, he found the note:<BR><BR>"This Ix class has been replaced by C32F27I10" for brachygravitic <BR>endoranganathans and C^F64!3 for ailurophenolphthaleinic exoranganathans."<BR><BR>Tracing this through in turn, he found that they led back to the original<BR>C11F73I15!<BR><BR>At this point he called in the district Bibliothecal Technician, who pointed<BR>out that the misnudged sequence could be restored only by reference to the<BR>original Rx.  Through the area Bibliothecal Engineer, an emergency message<BR>was sent to the chief himself, Mlvl Dwy Smith.<BR><BR>Without hesitation, His Bibliothecal Excellency pressed the master button<BR>on his desk and queried the Ix System for: "Knowledge, Universal - All<BR>Rx-Drawers, Location of."<BR><BR>To his stunned surprise, the answer came back: "See also C11F73I15."<BR><BR>Frantically he turned dials, nudged quanta, etc., but it was no use. <BR>Somewhere in the galaxy-size flood of Ix drawers was the one and only <BR>drawer of Rx, the one that had once been installed with great joy.  It was <BR>somewhere among the Indexes, Bibliographies, Bibliographies of Bibliographies, <BR>Histories of Bibliographies, Histories of Histories of Bibliographies, etc.<BR><BR>A desperate physical search was started, but it did not get very far, <BR>breaking down when it was found that no communication was possible in the first<BR>place without reference to the knowledge stored in the Rx.  As the entire<BR>bibliothecal staff was diverted for the emergency, breakdowns in the access<BR>lines multiplied and tangled, until whole sectors were disabled, rendering<BR>further cooperation even less possible.  The fabric of this biped civilization<BR>started falling apart.<BR><BR>The final result you know from my first report.  Rehabilitation plans will be<BR>sent tomorrow.<BR>                                                             Yours,<BR>                                                             Yrlh Vvg<BR>                                                             Commander<BR><BR><BR><BR>(Handwritten memo) This report received L-43-102.
