I remember spending a lot of time in the service trying to find the next hymn in the hymn book, wondering when to stand up, when to sit down, when to kneel.  But I don't remember any of the sermons.  Certainly church was somewhere you went for weddings or funerals, not a part of your life.  As for Jesus: "Jesus was a Capricorn..." to quote a nonsense song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of my 'O' level year of high school, when I was 16, a teacher gave all her students bookmarks with a Bible verse on one side and a hand-written note on the other.  I thought that a bookmark with a Bible verse on it should go in a Bible, so I got hold of a Gideon's King James Version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout university I was friends with a few people in the UCCF Christian Union group, and occasionally spoke to them, looking for a good debate.  While at university I also met and became good friends with a girl, Vaniah, whose Christianity was the biggest part of her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1998, Vaniah moved to London and when I moved here in 2002 she was attending &lt;a href="http://www.st-helens.org.uk/"&gt;St Helens&lt;/a&gt; and invited me to come along, which I did -- a few time.  But remained solidly resistant to what I was hearing.  I did have lots of debates although these were less fun than I remember from uni because I didn't have the confidence in my position that most of the people I was talking to did in their position defending and explaining the Gospel.  I didn't come to church very often and stopped completely because I couldn't answer the questions and didn't want to change my life -- I thought I was good enough without Jesus in charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four years after that I met Heather on a sailing trip and though we were interested in each other she told me that she couldn't be in a relationship with me because I was not a Christian.  I started coming to St Helens again, listening to the Gospel and getting into discussions where I couldn't defend my resistance to Jesus.  I went to a &lt;a href="http://www.christianityexplored.org/"&gt;Christianity Explored&lt;/a&gt; course and really started wresting with my philosophy that there was no need to ask big questions because there were no clear answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark's gospel account of the life of Jesus certainly had big questions such as Jesus asking Peter &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%208:27-30&amp;amp;version=ESV"&gt;"Who do you say that I am?"&lt;/a&gt; - and it has big clear answers about what Jesus came to do.  More than that, I was convinced of the historic truth of the Gospel and the &lt;i&gt;terrifying&lt;/i&gt; prospect of living and dying as an enemy of God.  On the 19th December 2006 I put my faith in Jesus Christ and asked him to help me live for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changes since then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How I spend my money - started giving to the church.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spending more time with people.&amp;nbsp; I am quite happy on my own or hanging out with Heather, but I know that I need my church family and I can serve them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Married to Heather!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I still struggle, still fight temptation to do my own thing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So, what questions do you have that you don't know the answer to?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20582594-249376810126152010?l=www.richardneish.org%2Fblogs%2Frun-rich-run' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.richardneish.org/blogs/run-rich-run/2010/02/how-i-came-to-be-christian.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Richard Neish)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-20582594.post-8091021204710619575</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Mar 2009 09:30:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-03-23T09:38:57.718Z</atom:updated><title>Two hour canal run, 13.6 miles</title><description>In preparation for the London marathon, I'm starting to think in miles instead of kilometers.  Did a long run yesterday, focussed on time instead of distance.  Ran out along the Grand Union Canal until I had run for exactly 1 hour, then turned around and ran back.  Total run time, 2 hours, 1 minute, 44 seconds, so pretty happy that I wasn't significantly slower on the way back.  Feeling tired and slightly sore, but not injured, so twas a good run.  Hope to continue building time and distance so should be on target for 26th of April&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Route at http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2660802 &lt;br /&gt;Terrain: flat on road&lt;br /&gt;Distance: 21.8km&lt;br /&gt;Time: 2:01:44&lt;br /&gt;Pace: 5:35 min/km&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20582594-8091021204710619575?l=www.richardneish.org%2Fblogs%2Frun-rich-run' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.richardneish.org/blogs/run-rich-run/2009/03/two-hour-canal-run-136-miles.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Richard Neish)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-20582594.post-9089882678155842373</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2009 19:30:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-03-18T19:32:01.110Z</atom:updated><title>There and back again</title><description>Ran into work this morning, 6 miles, then back again this evening.

Down Abbey Gardens / Lisson Grove, then cut over to Edgeware Road and down to Marble Arch.  Entered Hyde Park via Speakers Corner and stayed on the outer path around Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens.  Back to Speakers Corner and around again for lap 2.  Shorter lap this time, just around Hyde Park, not Kensington Gardens as well, cutting through on The Ring / Exhibition Road / West Carriage Drive, then back to Marble Arch and back home along Edgeware Road and Hamilton Terrace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running was dead slow, just adding distance, and very happy with that.  Also had a bit of a detour on the way back (not shown on the route map or counted in the distance).  Stopped to help out a guy in a wheelchair with a flat battery.  Pushed him from Edgware Road, round the corner on to Oxford St and left him outside the KFC near Marble Arch station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been listening to "The Privileges of Partnership" talk series on Philippians while I run (&lt;a href="http://sthelens.audiop.org.uk/search/series/1911"&gt;http://sthelens.audiop.org.uk/search/series/1911&lt;/a&gt;), and nearly finished it on this run.

Up Abbey Road until it turned into West End Lane, past West Hampstead, then on to the A41 to the A406, along to the A5 and back down past Cricklewood and Kilburn to home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All on road, with a lot of car noise and fumes, and a bit of foot traffic at Kilburn High Street.  Even so, easy run as I didn't have to think too hard and could just zone out and plod happily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2527629&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrain: flat on road&lt;br /&gt;Distance: 13.5km&lt;br /&gt;Time: 1:11:54&lt;br /&gt;Pace: 5:20 min/km&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20582594-7778904364189995160?l=www.richardneish.org%2Fblogs%2Frun-rich-run' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.richardneish.org/blogs/run-rich-run/2009/01/saturday-morning-loop-135km.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Richard Neish)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-20582594.post-1187617026061258840</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2009 15:21:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-01-16T15:22:26.444Z</atom:updated><title>Work to home - 9.5km</title><description>Route at http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=2494892&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20582594-1187617026061258840?l=www.richardneish.org%2Fblogs%2Frun-rich-run' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.richardneish.org/blogs/run-rich-run/2009/01/work-to-home-95km.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Richard Neish)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-20582594.post-2088233693593593823</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2009 12:31:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-01-11T14:36:13.155Z</atom:updated><title>Home, round Hyde Park and back home - 13.4 km</title><description>Went out without starting my stopwatch, so time and speed for this run is an estimate.

On my third entry into the ballot, I have an accepted place in the London Marathon.  God willing, on the 26th of April 2009, I will be running the 42,195 metres around the streets of London.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm feeling very emotional about this, more and more as I think about it.  I'm scared, unhappy about the effort and training required, and at the same time, incredibly excited.  The more I think about it, the more excited I am about the training, the improvement in fitness I will get as I train, and of course, excited about race day itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've spectated the London Marathon a few times and get goosebumps even now, thinking about it.  The energy and sense of passion you get from the runners is phenomenal, even when you can see the tiredness and pain.  Bring it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not required to collect anything for charity, since I was accepted in the ballot, but I've decided to fundraise for the Bowel Cancer UK charity anyway, so if you are reading this, please make a donation at &lt;a href="http://www.justgiving.com/richardneish"&gt;http://www.justgiving.com/richardneish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More soon, once I've drafted a training schedule.  The initial plan is lunchtime runs two or three days a week, then a long run on the weekend, building in time and distance as I get into shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20582594-5782966284974580461?l=www.richardneish.org%2Fblogs%2Frun-rich-run' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://www.richardneish.org/blogs/run-rich-run/2008/10/runner-number-7124.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Richard Neish)</author><thr:total xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0'>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-20582594.post-2451614069638585150</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Nov 2007 10:07:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2007-11-17T10:22:53.657Z</atom:updated><title>Hampstead Heath Loop - 12.5 km</title><description>Way back in the end of July, &lt;a href="http://www.richardneish.org/blogs/run-rich-run/2007/07/hill-work.html"&gt;I talked about some hill work&lt;/a&gt;.  Well, three and a half months later, I finally did it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From home, up Finchley Road to Swiss Cottage, then up (very up) Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Village, along the top of Hampstead Heath via Spaniard's Road to the Spaniard's Inn, then along Hampstead Lane, past Kenwood House to Highgate Village.  Down the (very posh) West Highgate Hill to the bottom of the Heath, path the bathing ponds and the Parliment Hill fields.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the bottom of the Heath, I turned right on Gordon House Road, past Gospel Oak train station, then continuing straight on Mansfield Road and Fleet Road. Turned left at the Roayl Free Hospital and uphill on Pond Street.  Straight across at Rosslyn Hill to Lyndhurst Road (still uphill!) and then finally back to Fitzjohn's Avenue, down to Swiss Cottage and home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this took roughly 90 minutes, which sounds very slow, but it was early in the morning, coldish, uphill.

I really want to put in the long run training to be able to sustain this kind of aggressive pace over a marathon distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one 3-dose energy gel with me and fed at 3, 6 and 9 miles.  Basically I took a mouthful of energy gel 100m before the water stop, then washed it down with two to three mouthfuls of water.
